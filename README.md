### 2. Set Up Your Deezer API Key

- Sign up on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1) and obtain the Deezer API key.

### 3. Replace the API Key in Your Project

- Go to the file where you define your `Retrofit` instance and add the required headers for the API call:
    ```kotlin
    val retrofitBuilder = Retrofit.Builder()
        .baseUrl("https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/")
        .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
        .build()
        .create(ApiInterface::class.java)

    val retrofitData = retrofitBuilder.getData("eminem")
    ```
